        ## 1. OVERVIEW
        
        `CleverDict` is a hybrid Python data class which allows both `object.attribute` and `dictionary['key']` notation to be used simultaneously and interchangeably.  It's particularly handy when your code is mainly object-orientated but you want a 'DRY' and extensible way to import data in json/dictionary format into your objects... or vice versa... without having to write extra code just to handle the translation.
        
        `CleverDict` also calls a `.save()` method whenever an attribute or dictionary value is created or changed.  Initially the `.save()` method does nothing, but you either turn on the *"batteries included"* `.autosave()` feature (which automatically saves your data to a JSON file) or you can overwrite it with your own function to do other useful things automatically every time an attribute changes in future e.g.
        
        * pickle
        * encode
        * encrypt
        * serialise
        * save data to a config file or database
        * upload to the cloud
        * etc.
        
        No more slavishly writing your own "save" or "update" function and trying to remember to call it manually every... single... time... values change (or *might* change).
        
        The other main feature of `CleverDict` is that it supports **Aliases** which link to the original dictionary keys.  This is really handy for data mapping e.g. taking an API response and making it play nicely with your own data structures.

        ## 2. INSTALLATION
        Very lightweight; just one dependency (`click`):
        
            pip install cleverdict
        
        
        
        or to cover all bases...
        
            python -m pip install cleverdict --upgrade
        
        
        ## 3. BASIC USE
        
        `CleverDict` objects behave like normal Python dictionaries, but with the convenience of immediately offering read and write access to their data (keys and values) using the `object.attribute` syntax, which many people find easier to type and more intuitive to read and understand.
        
        You can create a `CleverDict` object in exactly the same way as a regular Python dictionary:
        
            >>> from cleverdict import CleverDict
            >>> x = CleverDict({'total':6, 'usergroup': "Knights of Ni"})
        
            >>> x.total
            6
            >>> x['total']
            6
            >>> x.usergroup
            'Knights of Ni'
            >>> x['usergroup']
            'Knights of Ni'
        
        The values are then immediately available using either dictionary or `.attribute` syntax:
        
            >>> x['life'] = 42
            >>> x.life += 1
            >>> x['life']
            43
        
            >>> del x['life']
            >>> x.life
            # KeyError: 'life'
        
        `CleverDict` objects can always be relied on to behave like dictionaries, but if you accidentally use any of its built-in method names as dictionary keys then (as you'd expect and hope) it won't overwrite those methods, but nor will its value be accessible using `.attribute` notation:
        
            >>> 'to_list' in dir(CleverDict)
            True
        
            >>> x = CleverDict({'to_list': "Some information"})
        
            >>> x['to_list']
            'Some information'
        
            >>> type(x.to_list)
            <class 'method'>
        
        If you use JSON, you can export data easily with `.to_json()` but all your values must capable of being serialised to JSON obviously, so no Python sets or custom objects unless you convert them to something that JSON *can* handle first:
        
            >>> x.to_json()
            '{"total": 6, "usergroup": "Knights of Ni"}'
        
            # You can also output to a file using:
            >>> x.to_json(file="mydata.json")
        
            â“˜ Saved 'x' in JSON format to:
            D:\Pete's Data\OneDrive\Python Scripts\mydata.json
            '{"total": 6, "usergroup": "Knights of Ni"}'
        
        
        You can also use the `.to_list()` method to generate a list of key/value pairs from a `CleverDict` object e.g. for Client/Server serialisation:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict({1: "one", 2: "two"})
        
            >>> x.to_list()
            [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two')]
        
        
        ## 4. OTHER EASY WAYS TO IMPORT/EXPORT DATA
        You can create a `CleverDict` instance using keyword arguments like this:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict(created = "today", review = "tomorrow")
        
            >>> x.created
            'today'
            >>> x['review']
            'tomorrow'
        
        Or use a list of tuple/list pairs:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict([("value1", "one"), ["value2", "two"], ("value3", "three")])
        
            >>> x.value1
            'one'
            >>> x.value2
            'two'
            >>> x.value3
            'three'
        
        You can use the built-in `.fromkeys()` dictionary method like this:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict.fromkeys(["Abigail", "Tino", "Isaac"], "Year 9")
        
            >>> x
            CleverDict({'Abigail': 'Year 9', 'Tino': 'Year 9', 'Isaac': 'Year 9'}, _aliases={}, _vars={})
        
        > *(\*) See Sections 5 and 7 below to find out what `_aliases={}` and `_vars={}` mean in the output above...*
        
        
        Or reuse an existing `CleverDict` object:
        
            >>> y = CleverDict(x)
        
            >>> y
            CleverDict({'total': 6, 'usergroup': 'Knights of Ni'}, _aliases={}, _vars={})
        
            >>> y is x
            False
        
        Or use `vars()` to import another object's data (but not its methods):
        
            >>> class X: pass
            >>> a = X(); a.name = "Percival"
            >>> x = CleverDict(vars(a))
        
            >>> x
            CleverDict({'name': 'Percival'}, _aliases={}, _vars={})
        
        
        Or import/export JSON strings or files with `.from_json()` and `.to_json()`:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict.from_json(file="mydata.json")
        
            >>> json_data = '{"None": null}'
            >>> x = CleverDict.from_json(json_data)
        
        Or import/export line ("`\n`") delimited strings or files with `.from_lines()` and `.to_lines()`:
        
            >>> lines ="This is my first line\nMy second...\n\n\n\n\nMy LAST\n"
            >>> x=CleverDict.from_lines(lines, start_at=1)
        
            >>> x
            CleverDict({1: 'This is my first line', 2: 'My second...', 3: '', 4: '', 5: '', 6: '', 7: 'My LAST'}, _aliases={'_1': 1, '_True': 1, '_2': 2, '_3': 3, '_4': 4, '_5': 5, '_6': 6, '_7': 7}, _vars={})
        
            >>> x.to_lines(start_at=7)
            'My LAST'
        
            >>> x.to_lines(file="lines.txt", start_at=1)
        
        ## 5. ATTRIBUTE NAMES AND ALIASES
        
        By default `CleverDict` tries to find valid attribute names for dictionary keys which would otherwise fail.  This includes keywords, null strings, most punctuation marks, and keys starting with a numeral.  So for example `7` (integer) becomes `"_7"` (string):
        
            >>> x = CleverDict({7: "Seven"})
        
            >>> x._7
            'Seven'
            >>> x
            CleverDict({7: 'Seven'}, _aliases={'_7': 7}, _vars={})
        
        `CleverDict` keeps the original dictionary keys and values unchanged and remembers any normalised attribute names as aliases in `._aliases`.  You can add or delete further aliases with `.add_alias` and `.delete_alias`, but the original dictionary key will never be deleted, even if all aliases and attributes are removed:
        
            >>> x.add_alias(7, "NumberSeven")
        
            >>> x
            CleverDict({7: 'Seven'}, _aliases={'_7': 7, 'NumberSeven': 7}, _vars={})
            >>> x.get_aliases()
            [7, 'NumberSeven']
        
            >>> x.delete_alias(["_7","NumberSeven"])
        
            >>> x
            CleverDict({7: 'Seven'}, _aliases={}, _vars={})
            >>> x._7
            AttributeError: '_7'
        
        
        ## 6. DEEPER DIVE INTO ATTRIBUTE NAMES
        
        Did you know that the dictionary keys `0`, `0.0`, and `False` are considered the same in Python?  Likewise `1`, `1.0`, and `True`, and `1234` and `1234.0`?  If you create a regular dictionary using more than one of these different identities, they'll appear to 'overwrite' each other, keeping the **first Key** specified but the **last Value** specified, reading left to right:
        
            >>> x = {1: "one", True: "the truth"}
        
            >>> x
            {1: 'the truth'}
        
        You'll be relieved to know `CleverDict` handles these cases but we thought it was worth mentioning in case you came across them first and wondered what the heck was going on!  *"Explicit is better than implicit"*, right?  You can inspect all the key names and `.attribute` aliases using the `.info()` method, as well as any aliases for the object itself:
        
            >>> x = y = z = CleverDict({1: "one", True: "the truth"})
            >>> x.info()
        
            CleverDict:
            x is y is z
            x[1] == x['_1'] == x['_True'] == x._1 == x._True == 'the truth'
        
            # Use 'as_str=True' to return the results as a printable string:
            >>> x.info(as_str=True)
        
            "CleverDict:\n    x is y is z\n    x[1] == x['_1'] == x['_True'] == x._1 == x._True == 'the truth'"
        
        You'll notice in the example above that `.info()` lists all the names assigned to the current instance rather than just referring to `self`.  If you want to get these names programmatically you can use the handy `.identify_self()` method:
        
            >>> a_more_meaningful_name = x
        
            >>> x.identify_self()
            ['a_more_meaningful_name', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        
        Did you also know that since [PEP3131](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/) many unicode letters are valid in attribute names?
        
            >>> x = CleverDict(Ð·Ð½Ð°Ñ‡ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ = "znacheniyeh: Russian word for 'value'")
            >>> x.Ð·Ð½Ð°Ñ‡ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ
            "znacheniyeh: Russian word for 'value'"
        
        `CleverDict` handles this and replaces all remaining *invalid* characters such as punctuation marks with "`_`" on a *first come, first served* basis.  To avoid duplicates or over-writing, a `KeyError` is raised if required, which is your prompt to rename the offending dictionary keys!  For example:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict({"one-two": "hypen",
                                "one/two": "forward slash"})
            KeyError: "'one_two' already an alias for 'one-two'"
        
            >>> x = CleverDict({"one-two": "hypen",
                                "one_or_two": "forward slash"})
        
        ## 7. SETTING AN ATTRIBUTE WITHOUT CREATING A DICTIONARY ITEM
        We've included the `.setattr_direct()` method in case you want to set an object attribute *without* creating the corresponding dictionary key/value.  This could be useful for storing save data for example, and is used internally by `CleverDict` to store aliases in `._aliases`.  Any variables which are set directly with `.setattr_direct()` are stored in `_vars` and these, along with `CleverDict` functions/methods are NOT exported when using methods like `to_json` and `to_list`.
        
            >>> x = CleverDict()
            >>> x.setattr_direct("direct", True)
        
            >>> x
            CleverDict({}, _aliases={}, _vars={'direct': True})
        
        Here's one way you could sbuclass `CleverDict` to create a `.store` attribute and customise the auto-save behaviour for example:
        
            class SaveDict(CleverDict):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    self.setattr_direct('store', [])
                    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        
                def save(self, name, value):
                    self.store.append((name, value))
        
        ## 8. THE AUTO-SAVE FEATURE
        You can set pretty much any function to be run automatically when a `CleverDict` value is *created or changed* for example to update a database, save to a file, or synchronise with cloud storage etc.  Less code for you, and less chance you'll forget to explicitly call that crucial update function...  You just need to overwrite the `CleverDict.save` method with your own one:
        
            >>> CleverDict.save = your_save_function
        
        Similarly the `CleverDict.delete` method is called automatically when an attribute or value is *deleted*.  Like `.save`, it does nothing by default, but you can overwrite it with your own function e.g. for popping up a confirmation request or notification, creating a backup before deleting a record from your database, config file, cloud storage etc.
        
            >>> CleverDict.delete = your_delete_function
        
        Following the "*batteries included*" philosophy, we've included a powerful implementation of this feature for the oh-so-common scenario of wanting to dynamically Create, Remove, Update or Delete a JSON format file, and synchronise everything dynamically as the values in your `CleverDict` change:
        
            >>> x = CleverDict({"Patient Name": "Wobbly Joe", "Test Result": "Positive"})
        
            >>> x.autosave("json")
        
            âš  Autosaving to:
            C:\Users\Peter\AppData\Roaming\CleverDict\2021-01-20-15-03-54-30.json
        
            >>> x.Prognosis = "Not good"
        
            âœ“ .Prognosis updated in:
              C:\Users\Peter\AppData\Roaming\CleverDict\2021-01-20-15-03-54-30.json
        
            >>> x.autosave("off")
        
            âš  Autosave disabled.
        
            â“˜ Previous updates saved to:
               C:\Users\Peter\AppData\Roaming\CleverDict\2021-01-20-15-03-54-30.json
        
        You'll notice `CleverDict` helpfully created a JSON file that by default:
        
        - Included a timestamp, hopefully making it unique (enough) for the majority of uses
        - Was saved to the recommended Settings folder of your particular Operating System (thanks to the `click` package which is imported as a dependency)
        
        The path to your JSON save file is cunningly stored using `.setattr_direct` (see above) as `.json_path`:
        
            >>> x.json_path
            WindowsPath('C:/Users/Peter/AppData/Roaming/CleverDict/2021-01-20-15-03-54-30.json')
        
        If you want to customise things further, you also have direct access to the following convenience methods which use `.json_path`:
        
            >>> x.get_default_settings_path()
            >>> x.delete_json()
        
        If you ever need to restore the default "no action" behaviour of `.save` or `.delete` you can do so as follows:
        
            >>> CleverDict.save = CleverDict.original_save
            >>> CleverDict.delete = CleverDict.original_delete
        
        Or make use of the `.autosave` helper function:
        
            >>> x.autosave("off")
        
        **NB**: The `.save` and `.delete` methods are *class* methods, so changing `CleverDict.save` will apply the new `.save` method to ***all*** previously created `CleverDict` objects as well as future ones.
        
        
        ## 9. CREATING YOUR OWN AUTO-SAVE FUNCTION
        When writing your own `save` function, you'll need to specify three arguments as shown in the following example:
        
            >>> def save(self, name, value):
                    print(f" â“˜  .{name} (object type: {self.__class__.__name__}) = {value} {type(value)}")
        
        * **self**: because we're dealing with objects and classes...
        * **key**: a valid Python `.attribute` or *key* name preferably, otherwise you'll only be able to access it using `dictionary['key']` notation later on.
        * **value**: anything
        
        
        You can then overwrite the original `CleverDict.save` method as follows:
        
            >>> setattr(CleverDict, "save", save)
        
        
        ## 10. HANDY TIPS FOR SUBCLASSING
        
        If you want to specify different `.save` or `.delete` behaviours for different objects, consider creating subclasses that inherit from `CleverDict` and set a different `.save` function for each subclass e.g.:
        
            >>> class Type1(CleverDict): pass
            >>> Type1.save = my_save_function1
        
            >>> class Type2(CleverDict): pass
            >>> Type2.save = my_save_function2
        
        When you create a subclass of `CleverDict` remember to call `super().__init__()` *before* trying to set any further class or object attributes, otherwise you'll run into trouble:
        
            class Movie(CleverDict):
                index = []
                def __init__(self, title, **kwargs):
                    super().__init__(**kwargs)
                    self.title = title
                    Movie.index += [self]
        
        In the example above we created a simple class variable `.index` to keep a list of instances for future reference:
        
            >>> x = Movie("The Wizard of Oz")
            >>> print(Movie.index)
            [Movie({'title': 'The Wizard of Oz'}, _aliases={}, _vars={})]
        
        
        You might like to add a custom `__str__()` method to your subclass, for example calling on the `.info(as_str=True)` method:
        
            def __str__(self):
                output = self.info(as_str=True)
                return output.replace("CleverDict", type(self).__name__, 1)
        
        
        This allows you to print your objects' attributes with ease:
        
            >>> x = Movie("The Wizard of Oz")
            >>> print(x)
            Movie:
                self['title'] == self.title == 'The Wizard of Oz"

        ## 12. CREDITS
        `CleverDict` was developed jointly by Ruud van der Ham, Peter Fison, Loic Domaigne, and Rik Huygen who met on the friendly and excellent Pythonista Cafe forum (www.pythonistacafe.com).  Peter got the ball rolling after noticing a super-convenient, but not fully-fledged feature in Pandas that allows you to (mostly) use `object.attribute` syntax or `dictionary['key']` syntax interchangeably. Ruud, Loic and Rik then started swapping ideas for a hybrid  dictionary/data class, originally based on `UserDict` and the magic of `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`.
        
        > **Fun Fact:** `CleverDict` was originally called `attr_dict` but several confusing flavours of this and `AttrDict` exist on PyPi and Github already.  Hopefully this new tongue-in-cheek name is more memorable and raises a smile ;)
